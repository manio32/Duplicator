# Duplicator

This code receives a word and multiplies the letters of that word by the desired amount in seprate lines.


1-How does it work?
First you have to give a word to the code.
for example "mani"
In the secod line you have to put a number for example 5.
the result will be:
mmmmm
aaaaa
nnnnn
iiiii
